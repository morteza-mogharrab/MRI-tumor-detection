# MRI Skull Image Analysis

## What the project does
This Python code provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing MRI skull images and identifying potential tumor regions. It is specifically designed for medical imaging analysis, with a focus on detecting potential tumors in MRI skull images. The code begins by importing essential libraries for image processing, including **NumPy** for array operations, **OpenCV (cv2)** for computer vision tasks, and **Matplotlib** for visualization. The core function, `sym_demo()`, orchestrates the processing steps, starting with prompting the user to input an MRI image file. Subsequently, it performs various image processing operations such as skull detection, segmentation, and calculation of Bhattacharyya coefficients to assess region similarity. The detected regions, including potential tumor locations, are then visualized alongside the original MRI image. Additionally, the code incorporates helper functions like `identify_skull()` for preprocessing and aligning skull images and `score()` for computing Bhattacharyya coefficients.

## Why the project is useful
This project serves a crucial role in medical imaging analysis, particularly in the fields of neurology and oncology. By automating the analysis process, it aids healthcare professionals in the early detection of tumors within the skull region. This capability can lead to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

## How users can get started with the project
To get started with the MRI Skull Image Analysis project, users should ensure that they have Python installed on their system along with the required libraries. The necessary library versions are as follows:
- **NumPy** version: 1.23.5
- **OpenCV** version: 4.8.1
- **scikit-image** version: 0.22.0
- **tkinter** version: 8.6
- **matplotlib** version: 3.8.2

Users can clone or download the project repository and run the main script. Upon execution, the program will prompt the user to select an MRI image file for analysis. Detailed instructions for running the program are provided within the code comments.

## Where users can get help with the project
Users can seek help with the MRI Skull Image Analysis project by referring to the comments within the code, which provide explanations of the various functions and processing steps.
